# FUTURE_CS_01
Security testing on a sample web application to identify  vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and authentication flaws
about the Task.
In this hands-on cybersecurity internship project, I have performed vulnerability assessment of a real-world or open-source web application. The goal is to identify security flaws using ethical hacking tools and OWASP standards. This type of project simulates real client work, especially for startups, SaaS companies, or e-commerce platforms that need to secure their websites.

Setting up and exploring a test web app (like DVWA)
Use scanning tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nikto
Test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF
Map the vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 threats
Document my findings with screenshots, impact level, and remediation steps
And Compile a Security Assessment Report (PDF format)
